## What is Directory/Path Traversal ?

•A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims
to access files and directories that are stored outside the web
root folder.

•By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash
(../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file
paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories
stored on file system including application source code or
configuration and critical system files

## How does it work ?

•file_read(“/htdocs/website/reports/” + user_input + “.pdf”)

```c
https://www.example.com/getfile?path=File2503sm
```


## Some common parameters or injection points
```c 
•file=
•location=
•lang=
• path=
• display=
•load=
•read=
•retrieve=

```

## Old school knowledge (1)

• Root folder

## Old school knowledge (2)
• Move up the current directory

• Terminate the current file name

## Detection

```c 
•file=foo/file1.txt
• Try: file=foo/bar/../file1.txt
• Match => vulnerable
•Different => ???

```
